This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `Make notes, To-dos and more. `

This is simply a note taking app that I developed for my own practice and for inclusion in my portfolio.

### `Project not in active development`

It is only front-end, therefore there is no data persistency via a server. For future, if I will decide to implement that, it would be most likely using next.js.

### `Credits`

Initial html and css provided by initial files from the fullstack course by Angela Yu on udemy. Everything else, including functionality (though checked for the more initial functionality with files from Angela Yu, not with some of the added features) via JS and css changes using mostly sass by Lukas Skerlik.
